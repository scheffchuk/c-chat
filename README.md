# C Chat: Multi-Model AI Chat Web App

A modern web application that enables users to interact with multiple AI models from a single interface, designed for students, developers, and researchers who value speed, comparison capabilities, and privacy.

## Background & Purpose

While the demand for multi-model AI chat interfaces is high, existing solutions often suffer from high costs, closed ecosystems, or performance issues. C Chat addresses these limitations by providing an intuitive, vendor lock-in free platform that combines educational value with practical utility.

## Development Status

**🚧 Currently in Active Development**

This project is under active development as a graduation assignment. The frontend UI is largely complete, but backend integration and AI model connectivity are still in progress.

### ✅ Completed Features
- Modern responsive UI with sidebar navigation
- Multimodal input interface (text, voice, file attachments)
- Theme switching support (light/dark mode)
- Multi-model selector UI (ready for backend integration)
- Chat interface layout and components

### 🚧 In Progress
- Backend schema and API endpoints
- Authentication system integration
- AI model connectivity
- Message persistence and chat history

### 📋 Planned Features
- Message actions (copy, upvote, branch off)
- Chat artifacts and file handling
- Settings page and user preferences
- Public/private chat visibility controls

## Key Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with sidebar navigation and theme switching
- **Multimodal Input**: Support for text, voice, and file attachments
- **Multi-Model Ready**: UI prepared for multiple AI model integration

## Current Limitations

⚠️ **Important**: This is a development version with the following limitations:

- **No Backend Integration**: Convex is configured but not connected to the UI
- **No Authentication**: User management and authentication not yet implemented
- **No AI Model Connectivity**: Model selector is UI-only, no actual AI integration
- **No Message Persistence**: Messages are not saved or retrieved
- **No Chat History**: Previous conversations are not stored
- **Limited Functionality**: Copy, upvote, and branching features not implemented

## Development

- **Development**: `pnpm dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- **Build**: `pnpm build` - Create production build
- **Lint**: `pnpm lint` - Run Biome linter
- **Format**: `pnpm format` - Format code with Biome

## Contributing

This project is currently in active development as a graduation assignment. The frontend UI is largely complete, and the next phase involves backend integration and AI model connectivity.
