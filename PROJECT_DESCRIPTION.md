# C Chat: Multi-Model AI Chat Application

## What is C Chat?

C Chat is a web application that lets you talk to multiple AI assistants from one place. Think of it like having several AI chatbots in a single, easy-to-use interface. You can compare how different AI models respond to the same question, switch between them easily, and keep all your conversations organized.

## Who is it for?

- **Students** learning about AI and how different models work
- **Developers** building AI-powered applications
- **Researchers** comparing how different AI models perform
- **Anyone** who wants an efficient way to interact with multiple AI assistants

## Why C Chat?

Many existing AI chat tools have problems:

- They're expensive to use
- They lock you into one service
- They're slow or hard to use

C Chat solves these by providing:

- A free, open platform
- Access to multiple AI models in one place
- Fast, responsive interface
- Privacy-focused design

## What can you do with it?

### Core Features (Available Now)

- **Chat with AI**: Have conversations with multiple AI models
- **Compare Responses**: See how different AI models answer the same question
- **Save Conversations**: All your chats are automatically saved
- **Sign In/Sign Out**: Secure account system to protect your data
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Choose your preferred theme
- **Multiple Input Types**: Type, use voice, or attach files
- **Real-time Updates**: See AI responses as they're being generated
- **Artifacts**: Interactive content that makes conversations more useful and extensible. Instead of just reading text responses, you can interact with rich content like code sandboxes (run and test code directly), maps (visualize locations and data), and other dynamic elements. This creates a more engaging experience and allows the AI to provide more than just text—it can create interactive tools and visualizations right in your chat.

### Coming Soon

- **Chat History**: Browse and search through your past conversations
- **Message Actions**: Upvote helpful responses or create conversation branches
- **Settings**: Customize your experience and preferences
- **Public/Private Chats**: Share conversations or keep them private
