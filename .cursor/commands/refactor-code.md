# Refactor Code

## Overview

Refactor the selected code to improve its quality while maintaining the same functionality, providing the refactored code with explanations of the improvements made.

## Steps

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
    - Extract reusable functions or components
    - Eliminate code duplication
    - Improve variable and function naming
    - Simplify complex logic and reduce nesting
2. **Performance Optimizations**
    - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
    - Optimize algorithms and data structures
    - Reduce unnecessary computations
    - Improve memory usage
3. **Maintainability**
    - Make the code more readable and self-documenting
    - Add appropriate comments where needed
    - Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
    - Improve error handling and edge case coverage
