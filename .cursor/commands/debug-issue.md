# Debug Issue

## Overview

Help debug the current issue in the code by walking through the debugging process systematically and providing clear, actionable solutions.

## Steps

1. **Problem Analysis**
    - Identify the specific problem or error
    - Understand the expected vs actual behavior
    - Trace the execution flow to find the root cause
2. **Debugging Strategy**
    - Add appropriate logging statements
    - Suggest debugging tools and techniques
    - Identify key variables and states to monitor
    - Recommend breakpoint locations
3. **Solution Approach**
    - Propose potential fixes with explanations
    - Consider multiple solution approaches
    - Evaluate trade-offs of different approaches
    - Provide step-by-step resolution plan
4. **Prevention**
    - Suggest ways to prevent similar issues
    - Recommend additional tests or checks
    - Identify code patterns that could be improved
