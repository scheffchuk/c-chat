# Run All Tests and Fix Failures

## Overview

Execute the full test suite and systematically fix any failures, ensuring code
quality and functionality.

## Steps

1. **Run test suite**
    - Execute all tests in the project
    - Capture output and identify failures
    - Check both unit and integration tests
2. **Analyze failures**
    - Categorize by type: flaky, broken, new failures
    - Prioritize fixes based on impact
    - Check if failures are related to recent changes
3. **Fix issues systematically**
    - Start with the most critical failures
    - Fix one issue at a time
    - Re-run tests after each fix
