# Security Review

## Overview

Perform a comprehensive security review of the current code and provide specific remediation steps with code examples for each security issue identified.

## Steps

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
    - Verify proper authentication mechanisms
    - Check authorization controls and permission systems
    - Review session management and token handling
    - Ensure secure password policies and storage
2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
    - Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities
    - Check for XSS and CSRF attack vectors
    - Validate all user inputs and API parameters
    - Review file upload and processing security
3. **Data Protection**
    - Ensure sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
    - Check for data exposure in logs and error messages
    - Review API responses for information leakage
    - Verify proper secrets management
4. **Infrastructure Security**
    - Review dependency security and known vulnerabilities
    - Check HTTPS configuration and certificate validation
    - Analyze CORS policies and security headers
    - Review environment variable and configuration security
